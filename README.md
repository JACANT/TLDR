# TL;DR
iOS App Development
##Introduction
Straight up, TL;DR is an app(iOS only. Sorry, I'll learn Android soon) that reads essay online for you. Imaging when you are on the way to school, it is also the time you realize that there is an assinged reading for the class. Or there is a really interesting article online, but, unfortunatly, the reading glassses is no where to be found. TL;DR is made to parse out the article from the web, and read the article out loud for you.

`#TL;DR is designed for human being who has the ability to withstand Seri's voice for a significant ammount of time`
